# N/A Section Behavior Update

## Overview
When a section is marked as N/A, all its fields are automatically set to "N/A" or "Not Applicable" values. The new behavior ensures that if any field value in an N/A'd section is changed from "N/A" to any other value, the section will automatically be un-N/A'd.

## Implementation Details

### What Changed
1. **Modified `handleFieldChange` function** in `FormRenderer.tsx`:
   - Added an optional `sectionId` parameter
   - Added logic to check if the field being changed is in an N/A section
   - If the new value is not "N/A" or "Not Applicable", the section is removed from the N/A sections set

2. **Updated all field change handlers** to pass the sectionId when calling `handleFieldChange`

### How It Works
```typescript
// When a field value changes in an N/A section
if (sectionId && naSections.has(sectionId)) {
  // Check if the new value is not N/A or Not Applicable
  const isNotNaValue = value !== 'N/A' && value !== 'Not Applicable' && 
                      !(Array.isArray(value) && value.length === 1 && 
                        (value[0] === 'N/A' || value[0] === 'Not Applicable'));
  
  if (isNotNaValue) {
    // Remove the section from N/A sections
    setNaSections((prev) => {
      const updated = new Set(prev);
      updated.delete(sectionId);
      return updated;
    });
  }
}
```

## Testing the Feature

To test this behavior:

1. **Create a form with N/A-able sections**:
   - Ensure sections have `naable: true` in their configuration
   - Include fields with various types (text, select, radio, checkbox)

2. **Test the flow**:
   - Navigate to a section with the N/A checkbox
   - Check the N/A checkbox - all fields should be filled with "N/A" or "Not Applicable"
   - Change any field value from "N/A" to something else
   - The N/A checkbox should automatically uncheck
   - The section should no longer be marked as N/A

3. **Edge cases to test**:
   - Changing a field value within an N/A section
   - Array fields (checkboxes) with single "N/A" value
   - Fields with "Not Applicable" as an option vs plain "N/A"
   - Multiple fields in the same section

## Benefits
- **Improved user experience**: Users don't need to manually uncheck N/A when they start filling out fields
- **Data consistency**: Prevents sections from being marked as N/A while containing actual data
- **Intuitive behavior**: Aligns with user expectations - entering data in a field implies the section is applicable
