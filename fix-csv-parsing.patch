The issue with CSV parsing is that the current implementation splits the content by newlines first, which breaks multi-line quoted fields.

Current behavior:
- Line 21: content.trim().split('\n') splits the entire content by newlines
- This happens BEFORE the parseRow function can handle quotes
- Multi-line quoted fields get broken into separate lines

Fix needed:
- Parse character by character instead of splitting by newlines first
- Track whether we're inside quotes to know when newlines are field content vs row delimiters
- Only treat newlines as row delimiters when not inside quotes

Test output shows:
- Expected: 1 row with 3 fields including multi-line text
- Actual: 3 malformed rows because the quoted field was split

The minimal fix is to replace the line-splitting approach with a proper state machine that respects quoted fields.
