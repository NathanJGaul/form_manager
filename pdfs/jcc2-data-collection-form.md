**\*Note:** The Test Team designed the following scenarios to be general and broadly applicable across the diverse range of JCC2 applications and user roles. We understand that JCC2 is a versatile suite, and the goal is to assess its core capabilities and workflows. If the scenarios presented do not align exactly with your experience and role, attempt to adapt the scenario to fit your work role and day-to-day use of the JCC2 applications, focusing on the underlying functionalities and data integration capabilities of JCC2 rather than specific task-oriented procedures you might typically employ.

A service disruption has been reported affecting a critical DoD network. The disruption is impacting user access to a key mission-essential application. Your task is to use JCC2 to:

1. Gather comprehensive data related to a real-world reported service disruption. Identify potential causes, affected systems, and any related alerts or incidents.
2. Assess the potential impact of the service disruption on your specific mission and area of responsibility (AOR).
3. Prioritize investigative efforts based on the assessed impact and available information.

The test team will observe whether there is documentation available to the users which provides steps to diagnose and repair or mitigate the failure. Error messages and logs generated by the failure will be reviewed by the test team to see if they were helpful in resolving the issue.

In the case of a failure or outage, the test team will record:
- Reason for any failure or outage.
- Corrective actions taken.
- The duration of outage.
- The time to restore functionality.
